<p>A lot of new trends can be seen, when you hear about Web design these days. Some of the most famous trends are chosen by the Web designers, Ux designers, Graphic designers, and so on.</p>

<p>As it is an era of technology, peeps are choosing different and modern styles in their inventions. Some years ago, designers were exploring more and more about three-dimensional activities.</p>

<p>Especially, in the case of designing, they like to provide drop shadows, stylistic characters, gradients, textures and another type of designs to make an element three-dimensional.</p>

<p>In recent years, designers are moving towards the flat design and almost flat design as it seems more modern, elegant, and crisp. Designers are converting this trend into their strength so that the content of the website should be more clear and focused.</p>

<p>Not only this, in the recent surveys, people were asked to analyze some of the websites. In the survey, same websites, but with different style were presented. One which was highly stylish with some content and other was simple with white space and same content.</p>

<p>The result was quite shocking. Whosoever wasn&rsquo;t able to read the content on the stylish website, they leave. As people were more focused on the simple with negative space and its content. Focusing on this concept, nowadays, designers are moving towards this strategy.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-exactly-is-flat-design">So, what exactly is Flat design?</h2>

<p><img src="/static/flat1.png" alt="image here" />
<em>Source: www.pixabay.com/en/house-clip-art-mansion-rich-floor-2744765</em></p>

<p>It is more sophisticated and is known as a cousin of minimalism. Flat designs look great with some limitations of minimalism. One hundred years ago, German Bauhaus designers were strictly against the fancy and intricate decoration of the arts and crafts movement.</p>

<p>Bold letters with colors and lots of different flat- shapes were in demand at that time. Those flat-color shapes have become a vogue in these days. In 2014, these flat designs look even more modern and fresh.</p>

<p>Apple, who don’t know this company? Apple is the first and only known company who uses the flat design for the famous iPod commercials in early 2000’s.
Not only Apple but also Microsoft implements the fashion design in redesigning the Windows 8.</p>

<p>So, flat design refers to:</p>

<p>•   No depth</p>

<p>•   No gradient</p>

<p>•   No drop shadow</p>

<p>•   No reflections</p>

<p>Just because of the arrival of Flat design on the market, the value of skeuomorphism (the plan idea of making things spoke to take after their genuine partners) has been reduced. People are concentrating more on its simplicity and functionality.</p>

<h2 id="almost-flat">Almost Flat</h2>

<p><img src="/static/login-page.jpg" alt="image here" />

<p>Two types of designs can be seen: flat and almost flat. Google have opted this design for the Gmail interface, and now for Google Plus UI.
Undoubtedly, as the name suggests almost flat. Almost flat refers to some often features like:</p>

<p>•   Gradients</p>

<p>•   Semitransparent panels</p>

<p>•   Drop shadows</p>

<p>•   Outlines</p>

<p>The almost flat design looks like a cut cardboard. The only difference between flat and almost flat design is that almost flat design helps people to differentiate between the element itself and background of which it is against.</p>

<p><img src="/static/almost-2.png" alt="image here" />
<em>Source: www.pixabay.com/en/browser-icon-internet-mobile-web-2389147</em></p>

<p>Both flat and almost flat designs have their own appearance. They both are mostly used with inviting and bright colors.</p>

<p>They both are helpful for keeping the elements sharp, spaced, clean, and maintains a minimalistic look which usually all designers aimed for.</p>

<h2 id="minimalist-design">Minimalist Design</h2>

<p>The greatest influence nowadays on a design is an effect of minimalism. Sometimes, the name of both minimalism and flat design is interchangeably used. But, the minimalism concept is quite different from flat design.</p>

<p><img src="/static/flat-apple.JPG" alt="image here" />
<em>Source: www.apple.com</em></p>

<p>The minimalism concept has its own history. It is seen that 96% of the flat design websites are minimalist websites. But minimalist websites are not considered as a flat design.</p>

<p>It is well known for the act of removing everything piece by piece and leaving just the imperative and needed elements.</p>

<p>So, it presents void spaces, elegant layout, and without three-dimensional structure. With the greater usage of geometry and shapes, designers are ready to show their websites in the market.</p>

<h2 id="how-and-when-should-i-use-flat-design">How and when should I use Flat design?</h2>

<p>Well, it is hard to say why we should use this new trend – especially if we have more decorative and 3D elements in the market.</p>

<p>It is kind of a new step in a new direction. It is refreshing the community, whether you are in the trend or against it.</p>

<p>Designers nowadays, thinking a step ahead of it. Peeps in the society are more concentrating on the content of the company. More decoration, colors, shadows etcetera hide the actual concept of the company behind it. If people didn’t find any useful item on the website, they just leave and never come back.</p>

<p>That’s why designers found that nothing more means a lot. They start providing the negative, white space with only two or three colors. In this way, the website won’t look dull and boring whereas a company will meet its goal also. To send the message to the society.</p>

<p><img src="/static/flat-and-almost-flat.jpg" alt="image here" />

<p>People have become smarter. It’s so hard to convince them. Therefore, large companies have decided to make the usability considerations easier. By shedding unnecessary styling, it makes cleaner code and easy adaptability. Moreover, it makes speedier pages.</p>

<p>It lends itself beautifully to each and every type of applications. Either it is on a desktop or a mobile screen, it is always legible and adaptable.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Undoubtedly, flat design has taken its own place in the design industry just as other styles did it before. There are obvious flaws of flat design in the digital world. But, it depends upon the designers that how they do experiment, test, and learn it. But it will eventually leave its dust and create its own roots.</p>

<p>It also generally cuts down on development time, makes the content more readable, and also navigable content. As because of new vogue in the market, it also has some cones. Making everything flat removes clue hat either it  is clickable or not.</p>
